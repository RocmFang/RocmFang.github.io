I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Data Storage and Application Lab (DSAL)](http://stlab.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Dan Feng](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/dfeng/zh_CN/index.htm).
I received my Ph.D. at HUST in September 2023, supervised by [Prof. Fang Wang](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/wangfang16/zh_CN/index/1704665/list/index.htm). During my Ph.D., I was also a joint Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Arijit Khan](https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~Arijit/index.html) and [Prof. Siqiang Luo](https://siqiangluo.com).

My research interests include System4AI, Graph Learning, and Big Data, with a particular focus on developing efficient and scalable AI systems on heterogeneous resources.
